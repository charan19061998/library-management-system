Library Management System
Project Overview:
The Library Management System is a backend system built using Python and SQL, designed to handle all aspects of library management, such as managing books, users, and library transactions. This system provides APIs for both librarians (admins) and library users. Librarians can add, update, delete books, and manage user accounts, while users can view available books, borrow, and return them.

Features:
Librarian/Administrator:
  Add, update, and delete books.
  Manage user accounts (e.g., add new users, update user information).
  View transaction history of borrowed/returned books.
  Manage fines and penalties.

User:
View the list of available books.
Borrow and return books.
View borrowing history.
Check fine status.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Python (Django)
Database: MySQL
API Framework: Django REST Framework (DRF)
Authentication: Token-based authentication (JWT or Session)
Version Control: GitHub
